# pyvoa
[Pyvoa](https://pyvoa.org) (Python Virus Open Analysis) is a collection of Python™ code that provides:

 - easy access to COVID-19 databases, as well as other viral datasets;
 - tools to visualize and analyze data, such as time series and maps.

This environment is designed to be accessible to non-specialists: high-school students learning Python™, university students, science journalists, and even researchers who are not familiar with data extraction. Simple analyses can be performed directly, while more advanced analyses can be carried out by users experienced in Python™ programming.

Pyvoa provides access to multiple databases and delivers data in a standardized format. It also ensures seamless integration with geolocation databases (handling country or region names, enabling joins across datasets with differing descriptions, and generating maps). This geolocation information can furthermore be reused for applications beyond viral data analysis.
